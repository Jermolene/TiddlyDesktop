!! Backups for ~TiddlyWiki 5 Wikis

Backups are automatically made every time saving changes results in a file being overwritten. The previous content of the file is copied to a backup file with a filename such as `\MyData\index.html_backup\index.20150107172517000.html`.

The path of the backup file can be an absolute path or a relative path to the directory containing the ~TiddlyWiki file. The backup path can contain the following special tokens:

* `$filename$` to stand for the filename portion of the URL of the ~TiddlyWiki file
* `$filepath$` to stand for the entire filepath of the URL of the ~TiddlyWiki file

<$edit-text tiddler="$:/TiddlyDesktop/BackupPath" class="td-big-textarea" tag="input"/>

<$button>
<$action-deletetiddler $tiddler="$:/TiddlyDesktop/BackupPath"/>
Reset to default
</$button>

(Note that backups for ~TiddlyWiki Classic wikis are managed within the TWC wiki - see "txtBackupFolder" in ~AdvancedOptions).

!! User Configuration Folder

This is the folder in which ~TiddlyDesktop stores internal configuration. Notably, the subfolder `user-config-tiddlywiki` contains the backstage wiki folder. If you are experiencing problems with ~TiddlyDesktop you can delete the entire configuration folder to reset TiddlyDesktop to default settings.

<$button>
<$action-sendmessage $message="tiddlydesktop-open-config-folder" $param="USER_CONFIG_FOLDER"/>
Open user config folder
</$button>
